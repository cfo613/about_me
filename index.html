			<p>To share a little more about myself, I live in the Big Apple and have kept myself busy working in
				consulting for the past 6 years. A lot of my previous project work centered around technology, but I never got
				the chance to get into the weeds of the technical solution (although I found myself wanting to!). One intensive coding
				course later, and I've discovered that my previous inclinations were not misguided - programming has become a real
				passion that I cannot wait to continue learning.</p>
